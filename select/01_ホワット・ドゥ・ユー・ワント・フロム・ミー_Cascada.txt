So there you are
Again you're circling all around
If you could only touch me now
Strangers from the past
Don't hesitate
Now we're standing face to face
If heaven is the only place
Would you take my hand?
Just tell me
What Do You Want From Me?
This is love in the first degree
Tell me why
Everytime i feel your eyes all over me
Tell me
What Do You Want From Me?
Are you mad enough to see
That it's hard to cross the line
Come on now
Set me free
What Do You Want From Me?

Get closer now
Softly whisper in my ear
Please take me away from here
Away from all my tears
It's not too late
Now we're standing face to face
And heaven is the only place
Will you understand?
Just tell me
What Do You Want From Me?
This is love in the first degree
Tell me why
Everytime i feel your eyes all over me
Oh
Tell me
What Do You Want From Me?
Are you mad enough to see
That it's hard to cross the line
Come on now
Set me free
And i know
If you give me this feeling i'll be there to hold you tight
Oh
Cause i'd show
Your love is a hero
We will run, run out of sight
(What You Want?)

What Do You Want From Me?
This is love in the first degree
Tell me why
Everytime i feel your eyes all over me
(What You Want?)
