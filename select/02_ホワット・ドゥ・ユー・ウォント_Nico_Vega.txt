It's easy
To turn a blind eye
Like it ain't there
It's goddamn messy
Take it all on
Wash it all down
No need to be so hasty
What you don't feel
And you can't see
Shouldn't make you crazy
Turn it all down, down, down

Say what do you want
What do you want from me?
Say what do you want
What do you want from me?

You've been lazy
Maybe you're afraid
Of sleeping in the dark
Like a little baby
With a nightlight
Well baby, its bad
You can go ahead and hate me
For bringing in news
But you could still choose
Ain't going to be a party
But you turn it all down, down, down

Say what do you want
What do you want from me?
Say what do you want
What do you want from me?

Here we go, round and round
No matter what we know
We gotta go around again
Here we go, round and round
No matter what we know
We gotta go around again
Here we go, round and round
No matter what we know
We gotta go around again

Say what do you want
What do you want from me?
Say what do you want
What do you want from me?
Say what do you want
What do you want from me?
Say what do you want
What do you want from me?
